generations:
  - name: "First Generation (E28)"
    start_year: 1984
    end_year: 1988
    description: "The original M5 was hand-built by BMW Motorsport and featured a modified version of the M1 supercar's 3.5L straight-six engine producing 282 HP. Available only as a four-door sedan with manual transmission, it was the fastest production sedan of its time. The E28 M5 established the blueprint for the high-performance luxury sport sedan segment, combining track-capable performance with practical four-door packaging and understated styling."

  - name: "Second Generation (E34)"
    start_year: 1988
    end_year: 1995
    description: "The E34 M5 continued with an evolved 3.5L straight-six engine (later increased to 3.8L) producing up to 340 HP in later European models. Available as a sedan and limited-production wagon (Touring), it featured a sophisticated chassis with unique suspension tuning, larger brakes, and subtle visual enhancements. This generation maintained the hand-built quality of its predecessor while offering increased refinement and technology."

  - name: "Third Generation (E39)"
    start_year: 1998
    end_year: 2003
    description: "Often considered the definitive M5, the E39 introduced V8 power to the lineup with a 4.9L naturally aspirated engine producing 400 HP, paired exclusively with a six-speed manual transmission. Available only as a sedan, it featured more aggressive styling than its predecessors while maintaining the understated approach. The E39 M5 is celebrated for its perfect balance of performance, handling, comfort, and practicality, representing a high point in the model's development before the introduction of more complex electronic systems."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (E60/E61)"
    start_year: 2005
    end_year: 2010
    description: "The controversial E60 M5 featured a Formula 1-inspired 5.0L V10 engine producing 500 HP, paired with a seven-speed SMG automated manual transmission (a traditional six-speed manual was later offered in some markets). Available as a sedan (E60) and for the first time as a factory wagon (E61) in some markets, it represented a technological tour de force with electronic damper control, variable M differential, and multiple engine and transmission settings. While initially polarizing due to its complex electronics and Bangle-designed styling, this generation has gained appreciation for its unique, high-revving powertrain."

  - name: "Fifth Generation (F10)"
    start_year: 2011
    end_year: 2016
    description: "The F10 M5 returned to V8 power, now with twin turbochargers, producing 560 HP (later 575 HP with the Competition Package). The seven-speed dual-clutch transmission provided quicker shifts than the previous SMG, though a manual was offered in some markets. Available only as a sedan, it featured a more luxurious interior, advanced technology including adjustable steering weight, and a more refined character than its predecessor. This generation marked the transition to forced induction for the M5, delivering massive torque increases and improved efficiency."

  - name: "Sixth Generation (F90)"
    start_year: 2017
    end_year: 2023
    description: "The F90 M5 featured an enhanced 4.4L twin-turbo V8 producing 600 HP (625 HP in Competition and CS variants), paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The biggest innovation was the addition of M xDrive all-wheel drive with a rear-wheel drive mode, providing both all-weather capability and traditional M car handling characteristics. Technology advanced with configurable drive modes, a digital instrument cluster, and enhanced driver assistance features. The limited-production CS variant offered reduced weight and enhanced performance."

  - name: "Seventh Generation (G90)"
    start_year: 2023
    end_year: null
    description: "The latest M5 continues the evolution with a plug-in hybrid powertrain combining a twin-turbo V8 with electric motors for increased performance and efficiency. Power is expected to exceed 700 HP, maintaining BMW M's performance focus while addressing emissions regulations. The exterior design features more aggressive styling, while the interior offers the latest technology including BMW's curved display. The seventh-generation M5 represents the model's adaptation to electrification while maintaining its position as BMW's high-performance executive sedan."
